# Frontier: A Digital Terrain Data Generator

Representing terrain in a digital form has many applications: movies, computer games, scientific simulations, architectural models, and others all work with digital terrain. Some of this data is sourced from the real world, such as the U.S. Geological Surveyâ€™s effort to map the Earth via satellite radar. Other terrain is designed by hand or algorithmically generated.

In all cases, it is desirable to have large amounts of sufficiently realistic terrain. Surveys to gather real-world data are expensive and may create incomplete datasets, while human and algorithmic designers may not capture plausible terrain features. The goal of Frontier is to address these problems by filling in missing data, extending existing data to cover more area, and using physical simulations to recreate landscape features in artificial data.
